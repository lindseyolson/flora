## flora

Each year, I spent time searching the web trying to find perennial plant species I owned to ensure their proper exposure and care. The issue was that I could never guarantee I had found the exact species.

Users of the app are allowed to:
- register
- login
- search and add plant species to their account
- upon selection of a plant, the exposure and care autopopulates in the details. A notes section is available per plant added, leaving room for jotting notes throughout the season.

Technologies used: MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js), JavaScript, bcrypt, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Angular-Xeditable, Angucomplete Alt, Filestack and Heroku.
